# mini_nn
CS133 course project: mini neural network



• Generic implementation of a neural network
		– Build a C++ library that
				• can load a pre-trained network definition file
				• contains an abstract definition of common layers and the composing elements
					– Linear transformations, convolutions
					– Response functions, output layers
					– Fully connected layers
			   • initializes concrete layers of the network with a suitable programming technique (e.g.	factory method)
               • applies it to some data
