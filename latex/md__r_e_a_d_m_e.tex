C\+S133 course project\+: mini neural network

Generic implementation of a neural network. Build a C++ library that
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item can load a pre-\/trained network definition file
\item contains an abstract definition of common layers and the composing elements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_linear}{Linear}} transformations, convolutions
\item Response functions, output layers
\item Fully connected layers
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item initializes concrete layers of the network with a suitable programming technique (e.\+g. factory method)
\item applies it to some data 
\end{DoxyItemize}
