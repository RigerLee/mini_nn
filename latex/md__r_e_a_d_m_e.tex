C\+S133 course project\+: mini neural network

• Generic implementation of a neural network – Build a C++ library that • can load a pre-\/trained network definition file • contains an abstract definition of common layers and the composing elements – \mbox{\hyperlink{class_linear}{Linear}} transformations, convolutions – Response functions, output layers – Fully connected layers • initializes concrete layers of the network with a suitable programming technique (e.\+g. factory method) • applies it to some data
